                                The first project is a menu-driven bank system which is related to file handling.
                                Besides that, I used Tkinter which is a standard GUI library for Python to finish a birthday present for my girlfriend.
                                Also, I have done a weather app using API to find out what the weather is like somewhere.

                                Together with three other members, I completed a library-like database.

                                The first project I did was this portfolio website, which took me two to three weeks.
                                On top of that, I built a website that uses the API to search for the weather,
                                I named it the <a href="weather.html" target="_blank" class="link-design">Weather App</a>.

                                By using Engati, I have built a chatbot related to the intestine.
                                The chatbot is able to answer simple questions about the intestine, such as diseases of the gut, functions etc.
                                People can "chat" with him to get some information about the intestine.

                                Power BI is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft that allows users to visualize and analyze data with interactive dashboards, reports, and other data visualization tools.
                                It helps users to create and share interactive reports, charts, and graphs in real-time.
                                With the help of Power Bi I was able to perform data cleaning, data visualisation and create simple dashboards.
                                For one of the assignments, I have completed the cleaning of a dataset related to FIFA football players and got a good result.

                                C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language, giving programmers more control over system resources such as memory and hardware.
                                In the C++ module, I have learned many data structures and algorithms, such as linked-list, stack, queue, sorting and searching algorithms, etc. 
                                With my knowledge of C++, I was able to build a console line application that focused on handling data structures and accessing data using specific algorithms.

                                The R language was used to analyse the house price dataset and generate graphs based on my hypothesis.
                                The results of this analysis will be used to make decisions, for example to find out why housing prices are high in a certain area, what type of households prefer what type of house, etc.
